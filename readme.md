# ML-Algorithm-Demonstrations

Welcome to the ML-Algorithm-Demonstrations repository! This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various machine learning algorithms and data exploration techniques using different datasets.

## Overview

This collection of scripts provides practical examples of different machine learning algorithms and data exploration methodologies. Each script focuses on a specific algorithm or technique, providing clear demonstrations using datasets and explanatory visualizations.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Python 3.11.5 is installed on your system.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Debopriyo2002/ml-algorithm-demonstrations.git
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the Scripts:**

    - **Data Exploration (Categorical and Nominal Data):** Run `practical2.py` to explore categorical and nominal data.
    - **Simple Linear Regression:** Execute `practical3.py` for a demonstration of simple linear regression.
    - **KNN Classification:** Run `practical4.py` to see KNN classification in action.
    - **Naïve Bayes Classification:** Execute `practical5.py` for a demonstration of Naïve Bayes classification.
    - **Classification using Decision Tree:** Run `practical6.py` for classification using decision trees.
    - **Classification using MLP:** Execute `practical7.py` to explore classification using Multi-Layer Perceptron.
    - **Data Clustering:** Run `practical8.py` for data clustering demonstration.
    - **Demonstrate data Exploration (Numeric Data):** Run `practical1.py` for data Exploration (Numeric Data).



### Note:
- Ensure the necessary dataset files are available or properly linked within the scripts to execute the demonstrations successfully.
- Modify any file paths or dataset paths within the scripts if needed to match your file structure.
- Each script contains comments and explanations to understand the code and its purpose.
